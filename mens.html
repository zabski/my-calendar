<h2 CLASS="western"><A id="what_is_menstruation"></A>What
is menstruation?</h2>
<P>Menstruation
(men-STRAY-shuhn) is a woman's monthly bleeding. When you menstruate,
your body sheds the lining of the uterus (womb). Menstrual blood
flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix and
passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods
last from 3 to 5 days.</P>
<h2 CLASS="western"><A id="what_is_the_menstrual_cycle"></A>What
is the menstrual cycle?</h2>
<P>When periods
(menstruations) come regularly, this is called the menstrual cycle.
Having regular menstrual cycles is a sign that important parts of
your body are working normally. The menstrual cycle provides
important body chemicals, called hormones, to keep you healthy. It
also prepares your body for pregnancy each month. A cycle is counted
from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period.
The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range
anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young
teens.</P>
<P>The rise and fall of
levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycle.</P>
<h2 CLASS="western"><A id="what_happens_during_the_menstrual_cycle"></A>
What happens during the
menstrual cycle?</h2>
<P>In the first half of
the cycle, levels of estrogen (the &quot;female hormone&quot;) start
to rise. Estrogen plays an important role in keeping you healthy,
especially by helping you to build strong bones and to help keep them
strong as you get older. Estrogen also makes the lining of the uterus
(womb) grow and thicken. This lining of the womb is a place that will
nourish the embryo if a pregnancy occurs. At the same time the lining
of the womb is growing, an egg, or ovum, in one of the ovaries starts
to mature. At about day 14 of an average 28-day cycle, the egg leaves
the ovary. This is called ovulation.</P>
<P>After the egg has left
the ovary, it travels through the Fallopian tube to the uterus.
Hormone levels rise and help prepare the uterine lining for
pregnancy. A woman is most likely to get pregnant during the 3 days
before or on the day of ovulation. Keep in mind, women with cycles
that are shorter or longer than average may ovulate before or after
day 14. 
</P>
<P>A woman becomes
pregnant if the egg is fertilized by a man's sperm cell and attaches
to the uterine wall. If the egg is not fertilized, it will break
apart. Then, hormone levels drop, and the thickened lining of the
uterus is shed during the menstrual period.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Day
	1</B> starts with the first day of your period. This occurs after
	hormone levels drop at the end of the previous cycle, signaling
	blood and tissues lining the uterus (womb) to break down and shed
	from the body. Bleeding lasts about 5 days. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Usually
	by <B>Day 7</B>, bleeding has stopped. Leading up to this time,
	hormones cause fluid-filled pockets called follicles to develop on
	the ovaries. Each follicle contains an egg. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Between
	<B>Day 7 and 14</B>, one follicle will continue to develop and reach
	maturity. The lining of the uterus starts to thicken, waiting for a
	fertilized egg to implant there. The lining is rich in blood and
	nutrients. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Around
	<B>Day 14</B> (in a 28-day cycle), hormones cause the mature
	follicle to burst and release an egg from the ovary, a process
	called ovulation. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Over
	the next few days, the egg travels down the fallopian tube towards
	the uterus. If a sperm unites with the egg here, the fertilized egg
	will continue down the fallopian tube and attach to the lining of
	the uterus. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If the egg is not fertilized,
	hormone levels will drop around <B>Day 25</B>. This signals the next
	menstrual cycle to begin. The egg will break apart and be shed with
	the next period.

	<P><B>Question:</B> Can stress cause

	<P><B>Response:</B> Regulation of
	menstrual periods is controlled by a complex hormonal balance.
	Likewise, the body's reaction to stress involves changes in the
	levels of many hormones. Because it affects hormone balance and many
	other processes in the body, psychological stress can also interfere

<h2 CLASS="western"><A id="what_is_a_typical_menstrual_period_like"></A>
<!-- End Article in Article -->What is
a typical menstrual period like?</h2>
<P>During your period, you shed the
thickened uterine lining and extra blood through the vagina. Your
period may not be the same every month. It may also be different than
other women's periods. Periods can be light, moderate, or heavy in
terms of how much blood comes out of the vagina. This is called
menstrual flow. The length of the period also varies. Most periods
last from 3 to 5 days. But, anywhere from 2 to 7 days is normal. 
</P>
<P>For the first few years after
menstruation begins, longer cycles are common. A woman's cycle tends
to shorten and become more regular with age. Most of the time,
periods will be in the range of 21 to 35 days apart.</P>

<P>As mentioned previously, when your
menstrual cycles come regularly, this means that important parts of
your body are working normally. In some cases, not having menstrual
periods can mean that your ovaries have stopped producing normal
amounts of estrogen. Missing these hormones can have important
effects on your overall health. Hormonal problems, such as those
caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or serious problems with
the reproductive organs, may be involved. It's important to talk to a
doctor if you have this problem. 
</P>
<h2 CLASS="western">Dysmenorrhea</h2>
<P>Dysmenorrhea (dis-men-uh-REE-uh) -
painful periods, including severe cramps. Menstrual cramps in teens
are caused by too much of a chemical called prostaglandin
(pros-tuh-GLAN-duhn). Most teens with dysmenorrhea do not have a
serious disease, even though the cramps can be severe. In older
women, the pain is sometimes caused by a disease or condition such as
uterine fibroids or endometriosis. 
</P>
<P>For some women, using a heating pad
or taking a warm bath helps ease their cramps. Some over-the-counter
pain medicines can also help with these symptoms. They include:</P>
<P>If these medicines don't relieve
your pain or the pain interferes with work or school, you should see
a doctor. Treatment depends on what's causing the problem and how
severe it is. 
</P>
<h2 CLASS="western">Abnormal
uterine bleeding</h2>
<P>Abnormal uterine bleeding is
vaginal bleeding that's different from normal menstrual periods. It
includes: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Bleeding
	between periods 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Bleeding

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Bleeding
	heavier or for more days than normal 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Bleeding after menopause 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Abnormal bleeding can have many
causes. Your doctor may start by checking for problems that are most
common in your age group. Some of them are not serious and are easy
to treat. Others can be more serious. Treatment for abnormal bleeding
depends on the cause. 
</P>
<P>In both teens and women nearing
menopause, hormonal changes can cause long periods along with
irregular cycles. Even if the cause is hormonal changes, you may be
able to get treatment. You should keep in mind that these changes can
occur with other serious health problems, such as uterine fibroids,
polyps, or even cancer. See your doctor if you have any abnormal
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>In the United States, the average
age for a girl to get her first period is 12. This does not mean that
all girls start at the same age. A girl can start her period anytime
between the ages of 8 and 15. Most of the time, the first period
starts about 2 years after breasts first start to develop. If a girl
has not had her first period by age 15, or if it has been more than 2
to 3 years since breast growth started, she should see a doctor.</P>
<h2 CLASS="western"><A id="how_long_does_a_woman_have_periods"></A>How
long does a woman have periods?</h2>
<P>Women usually have periods until
menopause. Menopause occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, usually
around age 50. Menopause means that a woman is no longer ovulating
(producing eggs) or having periods and can no longer get pregnant.
Like menstruation, menopause can vary from woman to woman and these
changes may occur over several years. 
</P>
<P>The time when your body begins its
move into menopause is called the menopausal transition. This can
last anywhere from 2 to 8 years. Some women have early menopause
because of surgery or other treatment, illness, or other reasons. If
you don't have a period for 90 days, you should see your doctor. He
or she will check for pregnancy, early menopause, or other health
problems that can cause periods to stop or become irregular.</P>

<h2 CLASS="western"><A id="how_often_should_i_change_my_padtampon"></A>
How often should I change my
pad/tampon?</h2>
<P>You should change a pad before it
becomes soaked with blood. Each woman decides for herself what works
best. You should change a tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours. Make
sure to use the lowest absorbency tampon needed for your flow. For
example, use junior or regular tampons on the lightest day of your
period. Using a super absorbency tampon on your lightest days
increases your risk for toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a rare but
sometimes deadly disease. TSS is caused by bacteria that can produce
toxins. If your body can't fight the toxins, your immune (body
defense) system reacts and causes the symptoms of TSS (see below). 
</P>
<P>Young women may be more likely to
get TSS. Using any kind of tampon puts you at greater risk for TSS
than using pads. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends
the following tips to help avoid tampon problems:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Follow

    <h2>Sidebar Overlay</h2>
    <p>The w3-overlay class can be used to create an overlay effect, when opening the sidebar. The w3-overlay class adds a black background with a 50% opacity to the "page content" - this effect will "highlight" the side navigation</p>
    <p>Click on the "hamburger menu" to see the effect.</p>
