is menstruation?</FONT></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Menstruation
(men-STRAY-shuhn) is a woman's monthly bleeding. When you menstruate,
your body sheds the lining of the uterus (womb). Menstrual blood
flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix and
passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods
last from 3 to 5 days.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="what_is_the_menstrual_cycle"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>What
is the menstrual cycle?</FONT></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When periods
(menstruations) come regularly, this is called the menstrual cycle.
Having regular menstrual cycles is a sign that important parts of
your body are working normally. The menstrual cycle provides
important body chemicals, called hormones, to keep you healthy. It
also prepares your body for pregnancy each month. A cycle is counted
from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period.
The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range
anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young
teens.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The rise and fall of
levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycle.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="what_happens_during_the_menstrual_cycle"></A>
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>What happens during the
menstrual cycle?</FONT></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the first half of
the cycle, levels of estrogen (the &quot;female hormone&quot;) start
to rise. Estrogen plays an important role in keeping you healthy,
especially by helping you to build strong bones and to help keep them
strong as you get older. Estrogen also makes the lining of the uterus
(womb) grow and thicken. This lining of the womb is a place that will
nourish the embryo if a pregnancy occurs. At the same time the lining
of the womb is growing, an egg, or ovum, in one of the ovaries starts
to mature. At about day 14 of an average 28-day cycle, the egg leaves
the ovary. This is called ovulation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After the egg has left
the ovary, it travels through the Fallopian tube to the uterus.
Hormone levels rise and help prepare the uterine lining for
pregnancy. A woman is most likely to get pregnant during the 3 days
before or on the day of ovulation. Keep in mind, women with cycles
that are shorter or longer than average may ovulate before or after
day 14. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A woman becomes
pregnant if the egg is fertilized by a man's sperm cell and attaches
to the uterine wall. If the egg is not fertilized, it will break
apart. Then, hormone levels drop, and the thickened lining of the
uterus is shed during the menstrual period.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">As mentioned previously, when your
menstrual cycles come regularly, this means that important parts of
your body are working normally. In some cases, not having menstrual
periods can mean that your ovaries have stopped producing normal
amounts of estrogen. Missing these hormones can have important
effects on your overall health. Hormonal problems, such as those
caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or serious problems with
the reproductive organs, may be involved. It's important to talk to a

are caused by too much of a chemical called prostaglandin

serious disease, even though the cramps can be severe. In older
women, the pain is sometimes caused by a disease or condition such as
uterine fibroids or endometriosis. </FONT>

    <h1>Sidebar Overlay</h1>
    <p>The w3-overlay class can be used to create an overlay effect, when opening the sidebar. The w3-overlay class adds a black background with a 50% opacity to the "page content" - this effect will "highlight" the side navigation</p>
    <p>Click on the "hamburger menu" to see the effect.</p>
