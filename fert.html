<H1>15 Factors That Affect a Woman's Fertility</H1>
<P>Trouble
getting pregnant? Here are some possible causes of female
infertility. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What
causes infertility? 
</H2>
<P>Most people know that
a woman's fertility decreases as she gets older, but even during her
most fertile (and otherwise healthy) years, lifestyle choices and
external factors can affect a woman's chances of having a healthy
baby.<BR><BR> Here are some of factors that do (or don't) affect a woman's fertility,
and what you can do about them if you are trying to conceive.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">
Obesity

</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Carrying
around extra pounds can affect hormone production and make it more
difficult for a woman to get pregnant. The
more weight a woman gains over her healthy weight, the more she tends
to experience decreased ovarian function. 
A study in <I>Fertility
and Sterility</I>
found that women who were obese at age 18 were more likely to develop
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and have problems with infertility.
PCOS is the most common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive
age, and the leading cause of infertility.<BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Being
too thin 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Just
as excess body fat can impact fertility, so can not having enough of
it. That may be because women who have very low BMIs are deficient in
leptin, the hormone that controls hunger and feelings of satiety.
Having low leptin contributes to the absence of menstrual periods. 
Maintaining a healthy body weight, one that falls in the normal BMI
range and that is reached through a healthy diet and moderate
exercise is one of the most important things a woman can
do to increase her chances of getting pregnant.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Getting older</H2>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When
a woman reaches menopause, usually in her 40s or 50s, she no longer
ovulates and is unable to get pregnant. But even in the decade or so
before menopause officially occurs, she may experience fertility
problems as her ovulation becomes less regular and her egg count
declines, a time known as perimenopause. <BR><BR>There's
no official age when fertility begins to take a dive, but many
doctors say that it often becomes increasingly difficult to get
pregnant after age 35. This age is different for every woman, though;
some may go through perimenopause earlier, while others remain
fertile through their 40s. That's why, it's
important for women of any age who are having trouble conceiving to
see a specialist sooner rather than later.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Your
mother 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Ask
your mom how old she was when she went through menopause. If she
started on the early side, then you probably will, too. Women
are born with a certain amount of eggs, and there are certain genetic factors that might make you born
with more or less eggs than usual, or that may make you use those
eggs faster than other average women. But you certainly aren't
doomed to relive the same exact scenario your mom did. External
factors that don't necessarily affect you could have impacted your
mom.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Household
chemicals 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Exposure
to pollutants, pesticides, and industrial compounds can decrease a
couple's ability to have children by up to 30%.
.
15 common chemicals were associated with early menopause. These chemicals
include nine PCBs (which have been banned since 1979 but still exist
in older products), three pesticides, two forms of plastics called
phthalates (often found in personal care items and beauty products
like perfumes and nail polishes), and the toxin furan, a byproduct of
industrial combustion.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Smoking

</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Smoking
can hurt a developing fetus, but lighting up can also drastically
affect a woman's chances of getting pregnant in the first place.
Smoking causes up to 13% of all infertility cases, according to the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
<BR><BR>Cigarette smoke disrupts hormones and damages DNA in both men
and women. And it doesn't have to be heavy
smoking, either. Even women who smoke moderately
or who are exposed to secondhand smoke have disrupted endocrine
function and can experience significant fertility issues.<BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Alcohol

</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There's
no evidence that a few drinks a week will affect your fertility, but
doctors do caution against heavy drinking, more than one
drink a day for women, who have been linked to an
increased risk for ovulation disorders. <BR><BR>You probably already know you should stop drinking
if you think you could be pregnant. Drinking during the early stages
of pregnancy (and possibly even before conception) has been linked to
premature births. As for whether it's safe to drink later in
pregnancy, the jury's still out. Many doctors say a small amount of
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">alcohol</SPAN>
is OK, but the CDC and Surgeon General say it's best not to indulge
since there is no proof that it's <I>not</I>
harmful to the baby.</P>	

<H2 CLASS="western">Breastfeeding

</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It's
a myth that you can't get pregnant while breastfeeding, but at the
same time, it's true that women who are still nursing one child may
have trouble conceiving another one. It impacts ovulation. It's not impossible, so it
shouldn't be used as your only birth control method ,but
it is a decision that can have a negative impact on your fertility.
Older moms who want to have another baby before they have to worry
about age-related fertility decline should discuss how long to
breastfeed with their doctor. Otherwise, it may be better to wait at
least a year and a half before having another child, anyway: a 2014
 study found that women who wait less than 18 months after having a child to conceive again
are more likely to have a shorter pregnancy and preterm birth. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Extreme
exercise 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Working
out helps keep you slim, strong, and full of energy, all
important when you're trying to get pregnant. Thing is, you can
overdo it:If you're exercising too much it can have a negative
impact on ovulation. It's not just an issue
that affects very thin athletes, either. A 2012 study
found that normal-weight women who exercised vigorously for more than
five hours a week had a harder time getting pregnant. <BR><BR>The
most obvious sign of a potential problem is a change in menstrual
cycle. It doesn't have to go away completely,
either. If you notice that it becomes lighter or
shorter, you should talk to your doctor about the implications for
your fertility and your health.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Injectable
birth control 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Once
you stop taking most forms of hormonal birth control, you can get
pregnant within a month. The one exception:
Depo-Provera, the injectable birth control. Each Depo-Provera
injection prevents pregnancy for 12 to 14 weeks and
while some women do get pregnant in as little as one month after that
protection wears off, it can take other women up to a year to
conceive. Doctors recommend women stop using injectable birth control
several months before they hope to get pregnant. <BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Thyroid
disease 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A
2015 study 
supports the long-suspected theory that thyroid disorders can
contribute to ovulation and pregnancy problems, and suggests that
women having trouble conceiving be tested for over- or underactive
thyroid. People with significant thyroid disease are typically
going to have some pretty obvious symptoms, but subclinical, undiagnosed hypothyroidism is certainly a
recognized problem as well, and we know it can have subtle effects on
fertility without a woman knowing it. <BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Caffeine

</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If
you're addicted to venti lattes, some studies suggest you may have
trouble getting pregnant. A 2011 study found that caffeine interferes with the muscle contractions
that help eggs travel from the ovaries and through the fallopian
tubes to the womb, while a 2012 Danish study revealed that drinking
five or more cups of coffee a day may cut a woman's chances of
successful in vitro fertilization by half. That said, other studies
suggest caffeine plays no role in fertility. Either way, if you're
struggling to conceive, it's worth taking a look at your caffeine
intake and cutting back if you're drinking more than 200 milligrams a
day, that's 1 to 2 200ml (8-ounce) cups of coffee.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Medical
conditions 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Health
issues such as polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, and uterine
fibroids can affect a woman's chances of getting pregnant or
successfully carrying a pregnancy to term. Women with autoimmune
disorders (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) may also have
trouble conceiving, since their bodies may reject a fertilized egg or
attack her partner's sperm. In many cases, though, women with these
health conditions can still get pregnant and have healthy babies,
says Dr. Arredondo. Working with a medical team to manage and improve
symptoms, and seeing fertility help if needed, can increase the
chances for success. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Sexual
health history 
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Sexually
transmitted infections like chlamydia and gonorrhea can cause pelvic
inflammatory disease and cause fertility problems, even years after a
woman contracts them. In fact, chlamydia can cause damage to the
fallopian tubes without any other symptoms, and many women may not
know they had the disease until they experience trouble getting
pregnant. <BR><BR>It's important to note, though, that vaginal
infections (like yeast infections) have no effect on fertility. <BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Stress

</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Women
with higher levels of an enzyme linked to stress had a harder time
getting pregnant in a 2014 study .
Researchers say this study doesn't indicate that stress alone is
responsible for fertility problems, but they do suggest that women
who have been trying to get pregnant for several months try adopting
a stress management program. <BR><BR>
