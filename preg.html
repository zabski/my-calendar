	her menstrual cycle?</FONT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Being aware of your menstrual
	cycle and the changes in your body that happen during this time can
	help you know when you are most likely to get pregnant. See how the
	menstrual cycle works.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The average menstrual cycle lasts
	28 days. But normal cycles can vary from 21 to 35 days. The amount
	of time before ovulation occurs is different in every woman and even
	can be different from month to month in the same woman, varying from
	13 to 20 days long. Learning about this part of the cycle is
	important because it is when ovulation and pregnancy can occur.
	After ovulation, every woman (unless she has a health problem that
	affects her periods or becomes pregnant) will have a period within
	14 to 16 days.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Knowing when you're most fertile
	will help you plan or prevent pregnancy. There are three ways you
	can keep track of your fertile times. They are the: 1) basal body
	temperature method; 2) calendar method; and 3) ovulation method
	(cervical mucus method).</FONT></P>
	<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="taking_your_temperature_to_conceive"></A>
	<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Taking your temperature to conceive</FONT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Basal body temperature is your
	temperature at rest as soon as you awake in the morning. A woman's
	basal body temperature rises slightly with ovulation. So by
	recording this temperature daily for several months, you'll be able
	to predict your most fertile days.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Basal body temperature differs
	slightly from woman to woman. Anywhere from 96 to 98 degrees
	Fahrenheit orally is average before ovulation. After ovulation most
	women have an oral temperature between 97 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit.
	The rise in temperature can be a sudden jump or a gradual climb over
	a few days.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Usually a woman's basal body
	temperature rises by only 0.4 to 0.8 degrees Fahrenheit. To detect
	this tiny change, women must use a basal body thermometer. These
	thermometers are very sensitive. Most pharmacies sell them for about
	$10. You can then record your temperature on our special Basal Body
	Temperature Chart (PDF, 555 KB).</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The rise in temperature doesn't
	show exactly when the egg is released. But almost all women have
	ovulated within three days after their temperatures spike. Body
	temperature stays at the higher level until your period starts.</FONT></P>

	likely to get pregnant:</FONT></P>

	before ovulation, you could get pregnant.</FONT></P>

	<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Using the ovulation method to
	conceive</FONT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The cervical mucus method (also
	known as the ovulation method) involves being aware of the changes
	in your cervical mucus throughout the month. The hormones that
	control the menstrual cycle also change the kind and amount of mucus
	you have before and during ovulation. Right after your period, there
	are usually a few days when there is no mucus present or &quot;dry
	days.&quot; As the egg starts to mature, mucus increases in the
	vagina, appears at the vaginal opening, and is white or yellow and
	cloudy and sticky. The greatest amount of mucus appears just before
	ovulation. During these &quot;wet days&quot; it becomes clear and
	slippery, like raw egg whites. Sometimes it can be stretched apart.
	This is when you are most fertile. About four days after the wet
	days begin the mucus changes again. There will be much less and it
	becomes sticky and cloudy. You might have a few more dry days before
	your period returns. Describe changes in your mucus on a calendar.
	Label the days, &quot;Sticky,&quot; &quot;Dry,&quot; or &quot;Wet.&quot;
	You are most fertile at the first sign of wetness after your period
	or a day or two before wetness begins.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The cervical mucus method is less
	reliable for some women. Women who are breastfeeding, taking
	hormonal birth control (like the pill), using feminine hygiene
	products, have vaginitis or sexually transmitted infections (STIs or
	STDs), or have had surgery on the cervix should not rely on this

	infertility. Lots of couples have infertility problems. About
	one-third of the time, it is a female problem. In another one-third
	of cases, it is the man with the fertility problem. For the

	<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">What causes of infertility in women?</FONT></H3>
	
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Some common reasons for
	infertility in women include:</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Age:</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
	Women generally have some decrease in fertility starting in their
	early 30s. And while many women in their 30s and 40s have no
	problems getting pregnant, fertility especially declines after age
	35. As a woman ages, normal changes that occur in her ovaries and
	eggs make it harder to become pregnant. Even though menstrual cycles
	continue to be regular in a woman's 30s and 40s, the eggs that
	ovulate each month are of poorer quality than those from her 20s. It
	is harder to get pregnant when the eggs are poorer in quality. As a
	woman nears menopause, the ovaries may not release an egg each
	month, which also can make it harder to get pregnant. Also, as a
	woman and her eggs age, she is more likely to miscarry, as well as
	have a baby with genetic problems, such as Down syndrome.</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Health problems:</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
	Some women have diseases or conditions that affect their hormone
	levels, which can cause infertility.</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Polycystic ovay syndrome
	(PCOS)</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">: Women with
	PCOS rarely or never ovulate. Failure to ovulate is the most common
	cause of infertility in women.<BR>With primary ovarian insufficiency
	(POI), a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. It
	is not the same as early menopause. Some women with POI get a period
	now and then. But getting pregnant is hard for women with POI.<BR>A
	condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the
	uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a
	fertilized egg from implanting or result in miscarriage.</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Reproductive problems:</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
	Common problems with a woman's reproductive organs, like uterine
	fibroids, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can
	worsen with age and also affect fertility. These conditions might
	cause the fallopian tubes to be blocked, so the egg can't travel
	through the tubes into the uterus.</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Lifestyle factors:</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
	Certain lifestyle factors also can have a negative effect on a
	woman's fertility. Examples include smoking, alcohol use, weighing
	much more or much less than an ideal body weight, a lot of strenuous
	exercise, and having an eating disorder. Stress also can affect
	fertility.</FONT></P>
	<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="what_causes_infertility_in_men"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">What
	causes infertility in men?</FONT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Unlike women, some men remain
	fertile into their 60s and 70s. But as men age, they might begin to
	have problems with the shape and movement of their sperm. They also
	have a slightly higher risk of sperm gene defects. Or they might
	produce no sperm, or too few sperm. Lifestyle choices also can
	affect the number and quality of a man's sperm. Alcohol and drugs
	can temporarily reduce sperm quality. And researchers are looking at
	whether environmental toxins, such as pesticides and lead, also may
	be to blame for some cases of infertility. Men also can have health
	problems that affect their sexual and reproductive function. These
	can include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), diabetes,
	surgery on the prostate gland, or a severe testicle injury or
	problem.</FONT></P>

	<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="what_is_the_treatment_for_infertility"></A>
	<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">What is the treatment for
	infertility?</FONT></H3>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">If you are having fertility
	issues, your doctor can refer you to a fertility specialist, a
	doctor who treats infertility. The doctor will need to test both you
	and your partner to find out what the problem is. Depending on the
	problem, your doctor might recommend treatment. About 9 in 10 cases
	of infertility are treated with drugs or surgery. <I>Don't delay
	seeing your doctor as age also affects the success rates of these
	treatments. </I>For some couples, adoption or foster care offers a
	way to share their love with a child and to build a family.</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Some treatments include:</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Drugs:</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
	Various fertility drugs may be used for women with ovulation
	problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the drug to
	be used. You should understand the drug's benefits and side effects.
	Depending on the type of fertility drug and the dosage of the drug
	used, multiple births (such as twins) can occur.</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Surgery:</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
	Surgery is done to repair damage to a woman's ovaries, fallopian
	tubes, or uterus. Sometimes a man has an infertility problem that
	can be corrected by surgery.</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Intrauterine insemination
	(IUI, artificial insemination):</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
	Male sperm is injected into part of the woman's reproductive tract,
	such as into the uterus or fallopian tube. IUI often is used along
	with drugs that cause a woman to ovulate.</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Assisted reproductive
	technology (ART):</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"> ART
	involves stimulating a woman's ovaries; removing eggs from her body;
	mixing them with sperm in the laboratory; and putting the embryos
	back into a woman's body. Success rates of ART vary and depend on
	many factors.</FONT></P>
	<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Third party assistance:</FONT></STRONG><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
	Options include donor eggs (eggs from another woman are used), donor
	sperm (sperm from another man are used), or surrogacy (when another
	woman carries a baby for you).</FONT></P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Finding the cause of infertility
	is often a long, complex, and emotional process. And treatment can
	be expensive. Many health insurance companies do not provide
	coverage for infertility or provide only limited coverage. Check
	your health insurance contract carefully to learn about what is
	covered. Some states have laws that mandate health insurance
	policies to provide infertility coverage.</FONT></P>
